# Webmark - Nano Challenge 1
I created an app called Webmark, an application for organizing my browser bookmarks. The goal of this app is to help me organize hundreds of bookmarks that I save and prioritize which one I want to read for later.

Some feature of the app:

- View, add, edit, and delete the bookmark
- Label for bookmark category
- Pin the bookmark to mark it as imporant
